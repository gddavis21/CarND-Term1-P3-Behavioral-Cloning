**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolutional neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolutional neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

The model consists of a convolutional neural network, configured as follows:

Image data is pre-processed in the model (see function create_initial_model):
* model assumes input RGB image data of size 320x160
* top 60 and bottom 20 pixels are cropped via Keras Cropping2D layer
* image data converted to floating-point and normalized via Keras Lambda layer  

Neural network layers added to the model (see function add_my_CNN_steering_layer):
* 2 convolutional layers using 5x5 filters and RELU activation, followed by max-pooling layer
* 2 more convolutional layers using 3x3 filters and RELU activation, followed by another max-pooling layer
* 2 fully connected layers using RELU activation
* final readout layer for steering angle computation

The model includes RELU layers and Max-Pooling layers to introduce nonlinearity. All weights are initialized using He initialization, which has been shown to be effective in combination with RELU activation.

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

Training the model with the final selection of training data, model parameters, and image augmentation/pre-processing displayed no apparent evidence of overfitting. I experimented with adding dropout layers, varying the number, placement and dropout probabilities. In all cases adding dropout appeared to result in underfitting the model and worse steering performance on the track. My conclusion is that for this model, the randomized image augmentation methods used are sufficiently robust to overfitting, precluding the need for dropout or any other explicit overfitting reduction methods (like L1/L2 regularization).

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (model.py lines 298-323). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an Adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 314).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
